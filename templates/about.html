      <p>
        This Diabetes Prediction application uses a machine learning model to
        predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various
        health indicators. By inputting information such as pregnancies, glucose
        levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes
        pedigree function, and age, the model provides a prediction to help
        users understand their risk. This tool is intended for informational
        purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional
        medical advice. Consult with a healthcare provider for accurate
        diagnosis and treatment.
